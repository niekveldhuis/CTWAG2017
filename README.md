Notebook for visualizing topic models using *pyLDAvis* and *Bokeh*. The visualizations are meant for exploring the topic models from different angles. The data are taken from [ORACC](http://oracc.org), in particular from the project [State Archives of Assyria Online](http://oracc.org/saao). The documents are mostly letters that belong to the royal administration of the Assyrian empire in the eighth and seventh centuries BCE.

This notebook was prepared for a meeting of the [Computational Text Analysis Working Group](http://dlabctawg.github.io/) at the D-lab, UC Berkeley.
